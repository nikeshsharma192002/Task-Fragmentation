# Task-Fragmentation


I've analyzed the provided code snippet and identified two potential approaches to fragment the functionality and UI:

# Option 1: Fragment the Functionality into Custom Hooks

1-useBurnTransactions hook: This hook can encapsulate the logic for fetching and managing burn transactions, including:
     -Fetching burn transactions from the blockchain based on the selected chain and token address.
     -Sorting and filtering transactions based on relevant criteria.
     -Handling loading and error states.
     
2-useBurnLogic hook: This hook can manage the burn process, including:
     -Checking wallet connection and balance.
     -Handling user input for the burn amount.
     -Interacting with the blockchain contract to execute the burn.
     -Updating transaction data and handling success/error scenarios.
     
3-Additional hooks: Depending on the complexity, you might create separate hooks for specific functionalities like chain selection, token information, UI state management, etc.

# Option 2: Fragment the UI into Selective Components

1-BurnForm component: This component can handle user input for the burn amount, button interaction, and displaying progress/success/error messages.

2-BurnStats component: This component can display information about the total supply, burnt tokens, circulating supply, and potentially price details.

3-BurnTransactionList component: This component can render a list of burn transactions with relevant details like timestamp, amount, chain, and transaction hash.

4-ChainSelector component: This component can remain independent as it manages chain selection functionality.

Choosing the Right Approach:

The best approach depends on your specific needs and preferences. Consider the following factors:

1-Complexity and reusability: If the functionality you want to fragment is complex and reused across components, using hooks is ideal.

2-Maintainability and readability: Breaking down the UI into components improves code readability and maintainability.

3-Future needs: Think about potential future changes and how fragmenting either the functionality or UI would impact them.
